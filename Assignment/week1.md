## Background research

### Common Language Infrastructure (CLI)
The CLI provides an executable code specification as well as providing a unifying infrastructure for creating and executing applications through its components (the CTS, CLS and VES). This unified infrastructure is compatible with several high-level languages and can be used on various computer platforms, essentially allowing those languages to be used without needing to be written with a specific architecture in mind.

### Virtual Execution System (VES)
The VES provides the support needed to execute instructions of the CIL. It supports a set of built-in data types. It also defines a hypothetical machine consisting of a model and state, control flow constructs, and exception handling.
